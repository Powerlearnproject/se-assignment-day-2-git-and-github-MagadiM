## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is  an important concept as it provides the users with the ability to save changes and various versions of the program. Version control allows the user to revert back to previous versions of the program and check on the source code to see what changes have been made, who made the changes and how they affect the source code. 
GitHub is a popular tool in managing versions because it provides developers with the ability to work together while reducing duplication and managing changes into the project. The platform allows users to check how the source code works and if it doesn’t work appropriately users can simply revert back to previous versions of the project.
Version control is important because it helps with the accurate and consistent management of data and source code. It provides a reliable platform where users can track the entire life cycle of the source code and this is vital as all information is not easily lost. The project’s integrity is maintained  because the platform prevents loss of data, corruption of source code, and any unauthorized modifications to the source code.
